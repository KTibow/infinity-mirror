Okay, so first of all, here's some credits:
- Thanks to the people on the Arduino fourm! You've helped my a lot.
- Thanks for HelTec's [OLED display API docs](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/blob/master/src/oled/API.md), and the [rest of their library](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/).
- Thanks to [simple-weather-card](https://github.com/kalkih/simple-weather-card). Your icons gave me the inspiration for the patterns, and your source gave me a really good mapping.
- Thanks to the [World Time API](https://worldtimeapi.org/) for the API.
- Thanks to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/), of course!
